WPF app has been created. Will be implemented following the video posted under "Term Project" on the Canvas course 
website.

Title name has been changed from "MainTitle" to "Yelp App" in the XAML code. Height left at 450 and 
width adjusted from 800 to 600 as per video.

Added two labels, two comboboxes (drop-down boxes) and a data grid to match Sakire's Video. Editted contents of labels 
to display State and City. Editted property name to better reflect labels, comboboxes, etc. Fontsize of stateLabel and 
cityLabel adjusted from 12 to 14.
