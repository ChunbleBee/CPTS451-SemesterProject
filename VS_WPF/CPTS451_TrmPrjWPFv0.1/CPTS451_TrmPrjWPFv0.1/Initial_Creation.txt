WPF app has been created. Will be implemented following the video posted under "Term Project" on the Canvas course 
website.

Title name has been changed from "MainTitle" to "Yelp App" in the XAML code. Height left at 450 and 
width adjusted from 800 to 600 as per video.

Added two labels, two comboboxes (drop-down boxes) and a data grid to match Sakire's Video. Editted contents of labels 
to display State and City. Editted property name to better reflect labels, comboboxes, etc. Fontsize of stateLabel and 
cityLabel adjusted from 12 to 14.

Function "AddState" created. Populates stateListComboBox with 4 initial states {WA, CA, ID, NV}.

Function "AddColumns2Grid" created. Populated with sample columns, headers and rows.
Created binding for the columns in function "addColumns2Grid".

Alot happened... created "SelectionChanged" properties for the cityListComboBox and stateListComboBox which allows for
when the state selected is switched, the city selection will be updated. When the city is selected, it updates the main 
data grid businessDataGrid.

Sakire is now about to show a way to automate the querying process.
Updated code with automated Querying for cityListComboBoxSelectionChanged and stateListComboBoxSelectionChanged.

Time in Video ~58 minutes. Sakire is talking about adding new windows but it is not needed for Milestone 1.
